            <h4>Developer's Note</h4>
            <p>
              Hi, I'm Alex Schearer the founder of Spotted Zebra Software. 
              I've been making games for a while, but always in two dimensions. 
              I wanted to learn how to make 3D games and decided that making 
              a game a week was a good, challenging way to do so. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Drive//Shaft is my first week long game. You're driving a fast 
              car late at night on a deserted island, and you're goal is to 
              collect as many mysterious glowing orbs as possible. The problem 
              is there are other people on the island, too, and they're all 
              better drivers than you! Drive//Shaft is a simple game which is 
              fun because driving fast at night is fun, and because physics 
              based, online gameplay is fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm releasing Drive//Shaft for one dollar so people can join 
              me in this crazy game-a-week adventure. If you'd like to share 
              your thoughts, please leave a review or post to the Steam forums. 
              If I get enough feedback I will improve the game based on 
              what player's want.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for reading this; I really hope you enjoy the game!<br />
