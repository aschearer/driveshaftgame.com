### What?
Drive//Shaft is an open-world, physics-based, multiplayer car racing game. Your mission is to be the first player to reach the mysterious glowing orb. First to ten wins. This is a great game if you have time to kill and want something silly and fun to play.

### Who?
Spotted Zebra Software is a one-person game company in Seattle Washington, USA. It's most recent larger title was [Tumblestone][1]. The company was founded by, me, Alex Schearer. I worked at Microsoft for a while then left to make games. When not game making I help organize for [Seattle Indies][2].

### Why?
After spending several years developing Tumblestone I was looking for something fun, new, and short to work on before starting my next larger project. As luck would have it, [an article][3] floated through [my office][4] which spun a tale of simple games launching on Steam. Inspired, a number of us set out to make a game-a-week and publish them to Steam. One week to design, develop, and publish a game! Drive//Shaft is my first entry in this endeavor.

### How?
Unity, the Unity Asset Store, Photon, crunching like crazy, 10-years of game development experience, many pots of coffee and tea, the amazing support of my wife, and the excellent help of my officemates.

### I Still Have Questions!
