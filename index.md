This game is great<br/>
Just like its trailer<br/>
It was made in one week<br/>
The game, not the trailer<br/><br/>

You drive really fast<br/>
But it's hard to see<br/>
You drive late at night<br/>
So it's not easy<br/><br/>

Your friends can play too<br/>
It's a race to the ball<br/>
Get there first for a point<br/>
It's a fun time for all<br/><br/>

So give Drive//Shaft a go<br/>
There's no reason to wait<br/>
It's only a dollar<br/>
You're going to do great
<br />
